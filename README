III. CONFIGURATION


I. REQUIREMENTS

	* web-server (apache or similar)
	* qgis-mapserver


II. INSTALLATION

Unzip and copy jq-webclient directory into a directory of your web-server (apache for example).

If necessary, change owner and permissions to directory:

	Go to jq-webclient:	
	
		* $ cd /var/www/jq-webclient
	
	Change group to files:
	
		* $ chgrp -R www-data jq-webclient

	Change group permissions:

		* $ chmode -R g+rx jq-webclient
		

III. CONFIGURATION

Go to "scripts" directory into jq-webclient.

	* cd jq-webclient/scripts

Edit globalParams.js file

Set the following parameters properly:

	* server :  IP or ADDRESS of your machine where you have installed jq-webclient
	
	Examples: 	192.168.10.12
				example.url.com
				
	* pathProject: here you have to set the directory where qgis project will be copied to
	
	I suggest to set 
		
		* /path/to/jq-webclient/projects  
		
	and put your qgis project file here.
	The directory "projects" exists so you don't have to create it.
	
	Example on Linux:  /var/www/jq-webclient/projects
	
	* nameProject: this is the name of your qgis project file
	
	Example:  polygon.qgs
	
	* epsgcode_display: this is the epsg code of coordinates you can display on the map. 
	
	You can have map and qgis project with a coordinate system 
	but you want to display coordinates in other coordinates system 
	
	* unit: unit of map ("m" for meters, "degree" for degree). 

	* GOOGLE_ENABLE: set to true if you want display google map layer
	
		ATTENTION: to enable this option your your qgis project must be in 900913 or 3857 (Spherical Mercator like google layer)
		
	* OSM_ENABLE: set to true if you want to display Open Street Map layer
	
	* CACHE_BROWSER: set to true if you want browser using local storage (cache in local)
	
	
Save the file.


Be sure that your qgis project file is in the correct directory setting up above.

Now you can try to connect to you jq-webclient and see layer/layers of your project
